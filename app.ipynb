Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood ves-\\nsels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny, 659\\narteries), brain damage,coma, and death.\\nThe patient should be given rescue\\nbreathing and, if necessary , placed on a\\nventilator without delay .

The condition may\\nalso cause failure of other systems; for\\nexample,\\nheart failure or kidney failure.\\nThere are two types of respiratory\\ndistress syndrome. The first is seen in\\npremature babies (see \\nprematurity): the\\nlungs are stiff and do not inflate easily\\ndue to a lack of \\nsurfactant, a group of\\nchemicals that keep the alveoli (tiny air\\nsacs in the lungs; see \\nalveolus, pulmonary)\\nopen.

Kidney\\ndisease is also called renal disease.\\nDescription\\nThe kidneys are a pair bean-shaped, fist-sized\\norgans that are located below the rib cage near the\\nmiddle of the back. In adults they filter about 200\\nquarts (190 L) of blood every day to remove waste\\nproducts that result from the normal activities of tis-\\nsues in the body. These wastes circulate in the blood.\\nand if not removed they would damage the body. The\\nkidneys also play a crucial role in regulating the\\namount of water and chemicals (electrolytes) in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2119\\nKidney disease, nephrons, the filter-\\ning units of the kidney . Urine, the waste\\nproduct from filtering, passes through\\ntubules to the medulla, collects in an area\\ncalled the renal pelvis, then travels through\\ntubes called ureters to the bladder.\\nFUNCTIONS\\nThe nephrons filter blood under pres-\\nsure and then selectively reabsorb water\\nand certain other substances into the\\nblood. Urine is formed from substances\\nthat are not reabsorbed (see illustrated\\nbox: the function of the kidney).\\nThe kidneys also regulate the body ’s\\nfluid balance. To do this, they excrete\\nexcess water, and when water is lost\\nfrom the body (for example, as a result\\nof sweating), they conserve it (see \\nADH).\\nIn addition, they control the body ’s\\nacid– base balance by adjusting urine\\nacidity . Lastly , the kidneys produce hor-\\nmones involved in the regulation of red\\nblood cell production and blood pressure.\\nkidney biopsy\\nA procedure in which a small sample of\\nkidney tissue is removed and examined\\nunder a microscope. Kidney biopsy is, rial, usually through ingestion.\\nDescription\\nThe kidneys are the primary organs of the urinary\\nsystem, which purifies the blood by removing wastes\\nfrom it and excreting them from the body in urine.\\nEvery day, the kidneys filter about 45 gal (180 l) of\\nblood, about four times as much as the amount that\\npasses through any other organ. Because of this high\\nvolume, the kidneys are more often exposed to toxic\\nsubstances in the blood and are very vulnerable to\\ninjury from those sources.\\nEach kidney contains over one million structures\\ncalled nephrons. Each nephron consists of two parts:\\nthe renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The renal\\ncorpuscle is where the blood is filtered. It is made up\\nof a network of capillaries (the glomerulus) and the\\nstructure that surrounds these capillaries (Bowman’s\\ncapsule). Blood flows into the glomerulus, where the\\nliquid part of the blood (plasma) passes through the\\nwalls of the capillaries and into Bowman’s capsule, the body such as sodium, potassium and\\nphosphorous.\\nInside the kidneys are about one million tiny units\\ncalled nephrons. Inside each nephron is a very thin\\nblood vessel called a capillary that twists around a very\\nthin tube called a tubule. This combination of capillary\\nand tubule inside the nephron is called a glomerulous\\nand it is here that the blood is filtered. Water, electro-\\nlytes, and waste products (but not red blood cells) can\\npass across the capillary wall and into the tubule. The\\nkidney then regulates how much water and which other\\nsubstances can pass back into the blood in the capillary\\nto keep the body in balance. Waste products, excess\\nwater, and excess electrolytes remain in the tubule and\\neventually leave the body as urine.\\nThe kidneys also release three regulatory chemi-\\ncals—erythropoietin, renin, and calcitriol—that affect\\nother functions in the body. Erythropoietin stimulates\\nthe bone marrow to produce new red blood cells.]</td>\n",

When people\\ntalk about cholesterol as a medical problem, they\\nusually are referring to high cholesterol. This can be\\nsomewhat misleading, since there are four compo-\\nnents to cholesterol.

The cholesterol\\nforms plaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which\\nrestricts or blocks the supply of blood to the heart,, constituent of body cells and also is\\ninvolved in the formation of \\nhormones\\nand bile salts. Cholesterol is made by\\nthe liver from various foods, especially\\nthose containing saturated fats (see \\nfats\\nand oils ), although a small amount is\\nabsorbed directly from cholesterol-rich\\nfoods such as eggs and shellfish.\\nBoth cholesterol and fats (triglycer-\\nides) are transported in the blood as\\nlipoproteins. These are particles with a\\ncore, which is made of varying propor-\\ntions of cholesterol and triglycerides,\\nand an outer layer made of proteins.\\nCHOLESTEROL-RELATED DISEASES\\nHigh blood cholesterol levels increase\\nthe risk of \\natherosclerosis (accumulation\\nof fatty deposits on the lining of the\\narteries) and with it the risk of \\ncoronary\\nartery disease or of stroke (damage to\\npart of the brain due to interruption of\\nits blood supply).

The full\\nlipoprotein profile also includes measurements of tri-\\nglyceride levels (a chemical compound that forms 95%\\nof the fats and oils stored in animal or vegetable cells)\\nand lipoproteins (high density and low density). Blood\\nfats also are called ‘‘lipids.’’ It is estimated that more\\nthan 200 million cholesterol tests are performed each\\nyear in the United States.\\nThe type of cholesterol in the blood is as impor-\\ntant as the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty sub-\\nstance and cannot be dissolved in water. It must\\ncombine with a protein molecule called a lipoprotein\\nin order to be transported in the blood. There are five\\nmajor types of lipoproteins in the human body; they\\ndiffer in the amount of cholesterol that they carry in\\ncomparison to other fats and fatty acids, and in their, cholesterol diet. Lipid-lowering drugs include bile\\nacid resins, ‘‘statins’’ (drugs that effect HMG-CoA\\nreductase, an enzyme that controls the processing of\\ncholesterol), niacin, and fibric acid derivatives such as\\ngemfibrozil (Lobid).Aspirin helps prevent thrombosis\\nand a variety of other medications can be used to treat\\nthe effects of atherosclerosis.\\nKEY TERMS\\nArteriosclerosis— Hardening of the arteries.

It often is called a ‘‘Pap\\nsmear.’’\\nPurpose\\nThe Pap test is used to detect abnormal growth of\\ncervical cells at an early stage so that treatment can be\\nstarted when the condition is easiest to treat. This\\nmicroscopic analysis of cells can detect cervical cancer,\\nprecancerous changes, inflammation (vaginitis), infec-\\ntions, and somesexually transmitted diseases(STDs)., death rate from this disease by 74% between 1955 and\\n1992. A 2003 study reported that the test reduces rates\\nof invasive cervical cancer by as much as 94%. In 2003,\\nthe FDA approved a new screening test that combines\\nDNA testing for the HPV type that causes the most\\ncases of cervical cancer with the standard Pap test,\\nincreasing its screening value.\\nThe Pap test, sometimes called a cervical smear, is\\nthe microscopic examination of cells scraped from\\nboth the outer cervix and the cervical canal. (The\\ncervix is the opening between the vagina and the\\nuterus, or womb.) It is called the ‘‘Pap’’ test after its\\ndeveloper, Dr. George N. Papanicolaou. This simple\\nprocedure is performed during a gynecologic exami-\\nnation and is usually covered by insurance. For those\\nwith coverage, Medicare will pay for one screening\\nPap smear every three years.\\nDuring the pelvic examination, an instrument\\ncalled a speculum is inserted into the vagina to open\\nit. The doctor then uses a tiny brush, or a cotton-, 91%; rates are below 70% for more severe invasive\\ncancer. That is why prevention, risk reduction, and\\nfrequent Pap tests are the best defense for a woman’s\\ngynecologic health.\\nThe Pap test is a procedure used to detect abnor-\\nmal growth of cervical cells which may be a precursor\\nto cancer of the cervix. It is administered by a physi-\\ncian who inserts a speculum into the vagina to open\\nand separate the vaginal walls. A spatula is then\\ninserted to scrape cells from the cervix. These cells\\nare transferred onto glass slides for laboratory analy-\\nsis. The Pap test may also identify vaginitis, some\\nsexually transmitted diseases, and cancers of the\\nuterus and ovaries.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\n‘‘American Cancer Society Issues New Early Detection\\nGuidelines.’’ Women’s Health WeeklyDecember 19,\\n2002: 12.\\nLaw, Malcolm. ‘‘How Frequently Should Cervical\\nScreening Be Conducted.’’Important Journal of\\nMedical Screening(Winter 2003): 159–161.\\nOTHER\\n‘‘Pap smear: Simple, life-saving test.’’ April 29, 1999., pelvic region and heavy bleeding from the vagina.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Pap test\\nMost often, cervical cancer is first detected with a\\nPap testthat is performed as part of a regular pelvic\\nexamination.

Swelling can be addressed using botanical thera-\\npies. Bromelain, a pineapple enzyme, and turmeric\\n(Curcuma longa) are the most potent botanical reme-\\ndies for this purpose. Acute homeopathic care with\\narnica (Arnica montana) can reduce the trauma to the\\nbody. Ligament and tendon strengthening can be\\nassisted both botanically and homeopathically.\\nPrognosis\\nJoint ligaments have poor blood supply and,\\ntherefore, heal slowly. This healing process continues\\nlong after the symptoms of the dislocation injury have\\ndiminished. Once a joint has been either subluxated or\\ncompletely dislocated, the connective tissue binding or\\nholding it in correct alignment is stretched to such an\\nextent that the joint becomes extremely vulnerable to, food allergies may have a role. Diet changes and\\nvitamin supplements may be helpful. The use of\\nherbs, homeopathy, aromatherapy ,a n dhydrother-\\napy can help relieve symptoms. Ginger is useful in\\nreducing inflammation. Acupuncture has been pro-\\nven effective in treating hip and shoulder pain caused\\nby bursitis and other conditions.

It causes pain and\\nswelling.

Yoga has been used for RA patients\\nto promote relaxation, relieve stress, and improve flexi-\\nbility. Nutritionists suggest that a vegetarian diet low\\nin animal products and sugar may help to decrease\\nboth inflammation and pain from RA. Beneficial\\nfoods for patients with RA include cold water fish\\n(mackerel, herring, salmon, and sardines) and flavo-\\nnoid-rich berries (cherries, blueberries, hawthorn ber-\\nries, blackberries, etc.).\\nRA, considered an autoimmune disorder, is often\\nconnected with food allergies/intolerances. An elimi-\\nnation/challenge diet can help to decrease symptoms\\nof RA as well as identify the foods that should be\\neliminated to prevent flare-ups and recurrences., and relaxation techniques such asyoga, hypnosis, and\\nmeditation. Herbal therapies are gaining increased\\nrecognition as viable options; for example, capsaicin,\\nthe component that makes cayenne peppers spicy, is\\nused in ointments to relieve the joint pain associated\\nwith arthritis. Contrasthydrotherapy can also be very\\nbeneficial for pain relief.\\nLifestyles can be changed to incorporate a healthier\\ndiet and regularexercise. Regular exercise, aside from\\nrelievingstress, has been shown to increase endorphins,\\npainkillers naturally produced in the body.\\nPrognosis\\nSuccessful pain treatment is highly dependent on\\nsuccessful resolution of the pain’s cause. Acute pain\\nwill stop when an injury heals or when an underlying\\nproblem is treated successfully. Chronic pain and\\nabnormal pain are more difficult to treat, and it may\\ntake longer to find a successful resolution.

ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a\\nsyndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that\\nmake up one of the most important forms of lung or\\nrespiratory failure. It can develop quite suddenly in\\npersons whose lungs have been perfectly normal.\\nVery often ARDS is a true medical emergency. The\\nbasic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or mem-\\nbrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of\\nthe small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing\\nsacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood ves-\\nsels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny, 659\\narteries), brain damage,coma, and death.\\nThe patient should be given rescue\\nbreathing and, if necessary , placed on a\\nventilator without delay . The cause of the\\nrespiratory arrest will be treated.\\nrespiratory distress syndrome\\nAn acute lung disorder that makes\\nbreathing difficult and leads to \\nrespira-\\ntory failure , resulting in life-threatening\\nhypoxia (an inadequate supply of oxy-\\ngen to the tissues). The condition may\\nalso cause failure of other systems; for\\nexample,\\nheart failure or kidney failure.\\nThere are two types of respiratory\\ndistress syndrome. The first is seen in\\npremature babies (see \\nprematurity): the\\nlungs are stiff and do not inflate easily\\ndue to a lack of \\nsurfactant, a group of\\nchemicals that keep the alveoli (tiny air\\nsacs in the lungs; see \\nalveolus, pulmonary)\\nopen. In adults, the condition is known\\nas acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n(ARDS) and may develop as a result of a\\nsevere injury or overwhelming infection\\n(particularly \\nsepticaemia)., into the blood, must be treated promptly to avoid the\\nlung injury that causes ARDS.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nSmolley, Lawrence A., and Debra F.

The most common cause of\\nthis disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune\\nsystem normally fights foreign invaders in the body\\nlike bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the\\nimmune systems attacks the body. In this case, the\\nimmune system produces antibodies that attack\\nthe adrenal glands. Addison’s disease generally pro-\\ngresses slowly, with symptoms developing gradually\\nover months or years. However, acute episodes,\\ncalled Addisonian crises, are brought on by infection,, the glands are stimulated into \\nproducing excess androgens (male \\nsex hormones); this can cause\\nmasculinization of female babies.\\nAutoimmune disorders\\nDeficient production of hormones by\\nthe adrenal cortex is called \\nadrenal\\nfailure; if the deficiency is due to disease\\nof the adrenal glands themselves, it is\\ncalled \\nAddison’sd i s e a s e.The most\\ncommon cause of Addison’s disease is\\nan autoimmune process (in which the\\nbody’s immune system attacks its own\\ntissues). Addison’s disease can take a\\nchronic course characterized by\\nweakness, weight loss, and skin\\ndarkening, or an acute form\\n(Addisonian crisis or acute adrenal\\nfailure), in which the patient may\\nbecome confused and comatose.\\nInfection\\nDestruction of the adrenal glands by\\ntuberculosis was once a major cause of\\nAddison’s disease but is now\\nuncommon.The onset of an infection \\nor other acute illness in someone with\\nAddison’s disease can precipitate acute\\nadrenal failure.\\nImpaired blood supply, out the body are disrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all\\nages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is\\nthe destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adre-\\nnal cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign,\\nand destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruc-\\ntion of the adrenal cortex is caused bytuberculosis.T h e\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused\\nby fungal infections, such ashistoplasmosis, coccidio-\\nmycosis, andcryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\ncalled granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis,i n]   \n",

Kidney\\ndisease is also called renal disease.\\nDescription\\nThe kidneys are a pair bean-shaped, fist-sized\\norgans that are located below the rib cage near the\\nmiddle of the back. In adults they filter about 200\\nquarts (190 L) of blood every day to remove waste\\nproducts that result from the normal activities of tis-\\nsues in the body. These wastes circulate in the blood.\\nand if not removed they would damage the body. The\\nkidneys also play a crucial role in regulating the\\namount of water and chemicals (electrolytes) in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2119\\nKidney disease, nephrons, the filter-\\ning units of the kidney . Urine, the waste\\nproduct from filtering, passes through\\ntubules to the medulla, collects in an area\\ncalled the renal pelvis, then travels through\\ntubes called ureters to the bladder.\\nFUNCTIONS\\nThe nephrons filter blood under pres-\\nsure and then selectively reabsorb water\\nand certain other substances into the\\nblood. Urine is formed from substances\\nthat are not reabsorbed (see illustrated\\nbox: the function of the kidney).\\nThe kidneys also regulate the body ’s\\nfluid balance. To do this, they excrete\\nexcess water, and when water is lost\\nfrom the body (for example, as a result\\nof sweating), they conserve it (see \\nADH).\\nIn addition, they control the body ’s\\nacid– base balance by adjusting urine\\nacidity . Lastly , the kidneys produce hor-\\nmones involved in the regulation of red\\nblood cell production and blood pressure.\\nkidney biopsy\\nA procedure in which a small sample of\\nkidney tissue is removed and examined\\nunder a microscope. Kidney biopsy is, rial, usually through ingestion.\\nDescription\\nThe kidneys are the primary organs of the urinary\\nsystem, which purifies the blood by removing wastes\\nfrom it and excreting them from the body in urine.\\nEvery day, the kidneys filter about 45 gal (180 l) of\\nblood, about four times as much as the amount that\\npasses through any other organ. Because of this high\\nvolume, the kidneys are more often exposed to toxic\\nsubstances in the blood and are very vulnerable to\\ninjury from those sources.\\nEach kidney contains over one million structures\\ncalled nephrons. Each nephron consists of two parts:\\nthe renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The renal\\ncorpuscle is where the blood is filtered. It is made up\\nof a network of capillaries (the glomerulus) and the\\nstructure that surrounds these capillaries (Bowman’s\\ncapsule). Blood flows into the glomerulus, where the\\nliquid part of the blood (plasma) passes through the\\nwalls of the capillaries and into Bowman’s capsule, the body such as sodium, potassium and\\nphosphorous.\\nInside the kidneys are about one million tiny units\\ncalled nephrons. Inside each nephron is a very thin\\nblood vessel called a capillary that twists around a very\\nthin tube called a tubule. This combination of capillary\\nand tubule inside the nephron is called a glomerulous\\nand it is here that the blood is filtered. Water, electro-\\nlytes, and waste products (but not red blood cells) can\\npass across the capillary wall and into the tubule. The\\nkidney then regulates how much water and which other\\nsubstances can pass back into the blood in the capillary\\nto keep the body in balance. Waste products, excess\\nwater, and excess electrolytes remain in the tubule and\\neventually leave the body as urine.\\nThe kidneys also release three regulatory chemi-\\ncals—erythropoietin, renin, and calcitriol—that affect\\nother functions in the body. Erythropoietin stimulates\\nthe bone marrow to produce new red blood cells.]   \n",

When people\\ntalk about cholesterol as a medical problem, they\\nusually are referring to high cholesterol. This can be\\nsomewhat misleading, since there are four compo-\\nnents to cholesterol. These are:\\n/C15LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol\\n/C15HDL, the so-called good cholesterol\\n/C15triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk\\nfor heart disease\\n/C15total cholesterol\\nHigh LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major\\ncontributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol\\nforms plaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which\\nrestricts or blocks the supply of blood to the heart,, constituent of body cells and also is\\ninvolved in the formation of \\nhormones\\nand bile salts. Cholesterol is made by\\nthe liver from various foods, especially\\nthose containing saturated fats (see \\nfats\\nand oils ), although a small amount is\\nabsorbed directly from cholesterol-rich\\nfoods such as eggs and shellfish.\\nBoth cholesterol and fats (triglycer-\\nides) are transported in the blood as\\nlipoproteins.

The full\\nlipoprotein profile also includes measurements of tri-\\nglyceride levels (a chemical compound that forms 95%\\nof the fats and oils stored in animal or vegetable cells)\\nand lipoproteins (high density and low density). Blood\\nfats also are called ‘‘lipids.’’ It is estimated that more\\nthan 200 million cholesterol tests are performed each\\nyear in the United States.\\nThe type of cholesterol in the blood is as impor-\\ntant as the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty sub-\\nstance and cannot be dissolved in water. It must\\ncombine with a protein molecule called a lipoprotein\\nin order to be transported in the blood. There are five\\nmajor types of lipoproteins in the human body; they\\ndiffer in the amount of cholesterol that they carry in\\ncomparison to other fats and fatty acids, and in their, cholesterol diet. Lipid-lowering drugs include bile\\nacid resins, ‘‘statins’’ (drugs that effect HMG-CoA\\nreductase, an enzyme that controls the processing of\\ncholesterol), niacin, and fibric acid derivatives such as\\ngemfibrozil (Lobid).Aspirin helps prevent thrombosis\\nand a variety of other medications can be used to treat\\nthe effects of atherosclerosis.\\nKEY TERMS\\nArteriosclerosis— Hardening of the arteries.

It often is called a ‘‘Pap\\nsmear.’’\\nPurpose\\nThe Pap test is used to detect abnormal growth of\\ncervical cells at an early stage so that treatment can be\\nstarted when the condition is easiest to treat. This\\nmicroscopic analysis of cells can detect cervical cancer,\\nprecancerous changes, inflammation (vaginitis), infec-\\ntions, and somesexually transmitted diseases(STDs)., death rate from this disease by 74% between 1955 and\\n1992. A 2003 study reported that the test reduces rates\\nof invasive cervical cancer by as much as 94%. In 2003,\\nthe FDA approved a new screening test that combines\\nDNA testing for the HPV type that causes the most\\ncases of cervical cancer with the standard Pap test,\\nincreasing its screening value.\\nThe Pap test, sometimes called a cervical smear, is\\nthe microscopic examination of cells scraped from\\nboth the outer cervix and the cervical canal. (The\\ncervix is the opening between the vagina and the\\nuterus, or womb.) It is called the ‘‘Pap’’ test after its\\ndeveloper, Dr. George N. Papanicolaou. This simple\\nprocedure is performed during a gynecologic exami-\\nnation and is usually covered by insurance. For those\\nwith coverage, Medicare will pay for one screening\\nPap smear every three years.\\nDuring the pelvic examination, an instrument\\ncalled a speculum is inserted into the vagina to open\\nit. The doctor then uses a tiny brush, or a cotton-, 91%; rates are below 70% for more severe invasive\\ncancer. That is why prevention, risk reduction, and\\nfrequent Pap tests are the best defense for a woman’s\\ngynecologic health.\\nThe Pap test is a procedure used to detect abnor-\\nmal growth of cervical cells which may be a precursor\\nto cancer of the cervix. It is administered by a physi-\\ncian who inserts a speculum into the vagina to open\\nand separate the vaginal walls. A spatula is then\\ninserted to scrape cells from the cervix. These cells\\nare transferred onto glass slides for laboratory analy-\\nsis. The Pap test may also identify vaginitis, some\\nsexually transmitted diseases, and cancers of the\\nuterus and ovaries.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\n‘‘American Cancer Society Issues New Early Detection\\nGuidelines.’’ Women’s Health WeeklyDecember 19,\\n2002: 12.\\nLaw, Malcolm. ‘‘How Frequently Should Cervical\\nScreening Be Conducted.’’Important Journal of\\nMedical Screening(Winter 2003): 159–161.\\nOTHER\\n‘‘Pap smear: Simple, life-saving test.’’ April 29, 1999., pelvic region and heavy bleeding from the vagina.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Pap test\\nMost often, cervical cancer is first detected with a\\nPap testthat is performed as part of a regular pelvic\\nexamination.

The infected human cell is usually killed\\nand releases thousands of new viruses. The cell death\\nand resulting tissue damage causes the actual cold\\nsores. In addition, the herpes virus can infect a cell\\nand, instead of making the cell produce new viruses, it\\nhides inside the cell and waits. The herpes virus hides\\nin the nervous system. This is called ‘‘latency.’’ A, ‘‘host’’ means an animal (including a human) that\\ncan be infected with a particular disease. The word\\n‘‘vector’’ means an organism that can carry a particu-\\nlar disease-causing agent (like a virus or bacteria)\\nwithout actually developing the disease. The vector\\ncan then pass the virus or bacteria on to a new host.\\nMany of the common illnesses in the United\\nStates (including thecommon cold, many viral causes\\nof diarrhea, andinfluenza or ‘‘flu’’) are spread because\\nthe viruses that cause these illness can be passed\\ndirectly from person to person. However, dengue\\nfever cannot be passed directly from one infected per-\\nson to another. Instead, the virus responsible for den-\\ngue fever requires an intermediate vector, a mosquito,\\nthat carries the virus from one host to another. The\\nmosquito that carries the arbovirus responsible for\\ndengue fever is the same type of mosquito that can\\ntransmit other diseases, includingyellow fever. This\\nmosquito is calledAedes egypti.

       "0   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also called acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type of lung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any disease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in the lungs. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose lungs have been perfectly normal.  ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one of the most important forms of lung or respiratory failure. The basic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\n\\n\\n---\\n*Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.* \\n   \n",

In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is believed to occur due to an autoimmune disorder.  In about 20% of all cases, destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The remaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal gland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis, or a hemorrhage into the adrenal glands. \\n---\\n*Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.* \\n\\n\\n   \n",
